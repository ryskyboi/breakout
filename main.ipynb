    "Our trading fees are 0.035% per side.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to 3.5 basis points/side = 7 basis points per round trip (opening and closing a trade).\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, you are charged 0.035%/3.5 basis points when opening a trade, and 0.035%/3.5 basis points when closing a trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is calculated using the notional size of the position.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: You open a \\$100,000 notional position. The fee is 0.035%/3.5 basis points. You will be charged \\$35.00 when opening the trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example continued: You close a \\$100,000 notional position. The fee is 0.035%/3.5 basis points. You will be charged \\$35.00 when closing the trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a swap fee of 0.09% per open position per day. This applies to positions that are open at the daily rollover (0000 UTC). The swap fee will be deducted from your balance at 0025 UTC.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually very similar to a what a normal trading platform would charge and maybe actually a bit less than the average perps platform. We could possibly juice them a little bit"
